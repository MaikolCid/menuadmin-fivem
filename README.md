# Menuadmin-FiveM
In this menuadmin you will see different options to manage the people and server. One of the most important is to be able to do a Character Kill to a user (short CK) or to see from the perspective of the user, hearing them too. Too see the other options, see the below images (it's in spanish, translate it if you want).
This script will only work if you're using es_extended. Not working with extendedmode or anything else.


## How does the script works?

- You will need to put the corresponding permissions to the SQL. In the table of users > create a new column called permission_level.
- If you want to add some additional ranks for the admins, simply go to the table menuadmin and change it there.
